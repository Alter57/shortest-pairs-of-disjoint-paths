# About the project

The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm for finding <br/>
the shortest pair of disjoint paths between two nodes in a directed graph <br/>

The algorithm is based on the article: <br/>
<i> A quick method for finding shortest pairs of disjoint paths, J. W. Suurballe,
R. E. Tarjan, June 1984 </i>

# Input file format
The format of input file describing a directed graph is as follow: <br/>
<pre>
n 
a b w 
d h w
</pre>

where <br/>
n - the number of nodes <br/>
a,b,d,h - the node id (a number between 0 and (n-1)) <br/>
w - the weight of an edge connecting two nodes <br/>

A valid example of such a file is <pre>./dataset/parsing/example1</pre>
Files <b>./dataset/parsing/example2</b> & <b>./dataset/parsing/example3</b> are examples of invalid input.<br/>

# How to run it

TBD
